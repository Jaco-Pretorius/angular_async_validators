## What is this code?

This is the server-side component for my blog post on [Asynchronous Validations in AngularJS](http://www.jacopretorius.net/2015/03/asynchronous-validations-in-angularjs.html).  The Angular code is available on [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/9yTdOexWdByZd9Hj4iNG?p=preview).

## How do I run it?

After cloning the repo:

```
bundle install
```

To run the server:

```
ruby application.rb
```
